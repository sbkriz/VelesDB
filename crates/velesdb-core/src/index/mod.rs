/// Trait for vector index implementations.
///
/// All index implementations must be thread-safe (Send + Sync).
///
/// # Performance Note
///
/// For bulk insertions, prefer batch methods like `HnswIndex::insert_batch_parallel()`
/// over calling [`Self::insert`] in a loop.
/// Individual inserts incur per-call lock overhead that batch methods avoid.

    ///

    ///
    /// This method acquires locks for each insertion. For bulk loading, use:
    /// - `HnswIndex::insert_batch_parallel()` - Best for all batches
