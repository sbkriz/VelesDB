//! Lock-rank enforcement for HNSW graph operations.
//!
//! Defines the global lock ordering invariant and provides runtime
//! checking to prevent deadlocks. The rank system encodes the rule:
//!
//! ```text
//! vectors (rank 10) → columnar (rank 15) → layers (rank 20) → neighbors (rank 30)
//! ```
//!
//! Acquiring a lock with lower-or-equal rank than the highest currently
//! held rank is a violation that gets recorded in safety counters.
//!
//! # Release Build Behavior (F-25)
//!
//! In release builds, lock-rank tracking is a no-op for maximum
//! search throughput. Only the atomic violation counter is incremented
//! (no thread-local stack overhead). In debug builds, full stack-based
//! tracking with tracing warnings is enabled.
