//! Software-pipelined HNSW search.
//!
//! Overlaps prefetch of the *next* candidate's neighbor vectors with
//! distance computation of the *current* batch, hiding main-memory
//! latency behind useful ALU work.
//!
//! Activated automatically when vectors span >= 2 cache lines **and**
//! the dataset exceeds ~8 MB (so data is not fully L3-resident).
//! Produces **identical** results to the non-pipelined path — only
//! memory access order differs.
//!
//! # Pipeline strategy
//!
//! After gathering the current candidate's unvisited neighbors, the
//! algorithm **peeks** (without popping) at the next candidate in the
//! min-heap and speculatively prefetches that candidate's neighbor
//! vectors. Distance computation for the current batch then executes
//! while the prefetched data migrates through the cache hierarchy.
//!
//! Because the next candidate is only peeked — never consumed before
//! the current batch is fully processed — the heap exploration order
//! is identical to the non-pipelined loop, preserving recall.
