//! Zero-copy guard for vector data from mmap storage.

/// Zero-copy guard for vector data from mmap storage.
///
/// This guard holds a read lock on the mmap and provides direct access
/// to the vector data without any memory allocation or copy.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Using `VectorSliceGuard` instead of `retrieve()` eliminates:
/// - Heap allocation for the result `Vec<f32>`
/// - Memory copy from mmap to the new vector
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use velesdb_core::storage::{MmapStorage, VectorSliceGuard};
/// # use std::io;
/// # fn example() -> io::Result<()> {
/// # let mut storage = MmapStorage::new("/tmp/test", 128)?;
/// # let id = 1u64;
/// // Get zero-copy access to a vector
/// let guard: Option<VectorSliceGuard> = storage.retrieve_ref(id)?;
/// if let Some(guard) = guard {
///     let slice: &[f32] = guard.as_ref();
///     // Use slice directly - no allocation occurred
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```

///

/// If the mmap was remapped (epoch changed), access panics to prevent UB.
///
/// The epoch uses wrapping `u64` arithmetic. Overflow is theoretically possible
/// after 2^64 remaps (~584 years at 1B/sec) but practically irrelevant.
