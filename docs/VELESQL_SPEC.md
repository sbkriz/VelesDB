# VelesQL Language Specification

> SQL-like query language for vector search in VelesDB.

**Version**: 3.0.0 | **Last Updated**: 2026-03-07

## Overview

VelesQL is a SQL-inspired query language designed specifically for vector similarity search. It combines familiar SQL syntax with vector-specific operations like `NEAR` for semantic search.

### REST Contract Notes

- `/query` supports top-level `MATCH`, but request body must include `collection`.
- `/collections/{name}/match` is the collection-scoped graph endpoint.
- Canonical payload contract: `docs/reference/VELESQL_CONTRACT.md`.
- Conformance test matrix: `docs/reference/VELESQL_CONFORMANCE_CASES.md`.
- Recommended developer syntax for mixed filters:
  `SELECT ... FROM <collection> WHERE ... AND MATCH (...)`.

## Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT <columns>
FROM <collection>
[WHERE <conditions>]
[LIMIT <n>]
[OFFSET <n>]
[WITH (<options>)]
```

## SELECT Clause

### Select All Columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM documents
```

### Select Specific Columns

```sql
SELECT id, score FROM documents
SELECT id, payload.title, payload.category FROM documents
```

### Nested Payload Fields

Access nested JSON fields using dot notation:

```sql
SELECT payload.metadata.author FROM articles
```

## FROM Clause

Specify the collection name:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_collection
```

## WHERE Clause

### Vector Similarity Search

Use `NEAR` for approximate nearest neighbor search:

```sql
-- With parameter placeholder
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector NEAR $v

-- With literal vector
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector NEAR [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
```

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=` | Equal | `category = 'tech'` |
| `!=` or `<>` | Not equal | `status != 'deleted'` |
| `>` | Greater than | `price > 100` |
| `>=` | Greater or equal | `score >= 0.8` |
| `<` | Less than | `count < 50` |
| `<=` | Less or equal | `rating <= 5` |

### String Matching

```sql
-- LIKE with wildcards
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE title LIKE '%database%'
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE name LIKE 'vec%'

-- MATCH for full-text (if supported)
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE content MATCH 'vector database'
```

### NULL Checks

```sql
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE category IS NULL
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE category IS NOT NULL
```

### IN Operator

```sql
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE category IN ('tech', 'science', 'ai')
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

### BETWEEN Operator

```sql
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 100
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
```

### Temporal Functions (v2.1+)

VelesQL supports temporal expressions for date/time filtering using `NOW()` and `INTERVAL`.

#### NOW() Function

Returns the current Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch):

```sql
-- Events after now
SELECT * FROM events WHERE timestamp > NOW()

-- Recently created items
SELECT * FROM items WHERE created_at > NOW()
```

#### INTERVAL Expression

Defines a time duration:

```sql
INTERVAL '<magnitude> <unit>'
```

**Supported Units:**

| Unit | Aliases | Seconds |
|------|---------|---------|
| seconds | s, sec, second | 1 |
| minutes | m, min, minute | 60 |
| hours | h, hour | 3,600 |
| days | d, day | 86,400 |
| weeks | w, week | 604,800 |
| months | month | ~2,592,000 |

#### Temporal Arithmetic

Combine `NOW()` with `INTERVAL` for relative time queries:

```sql
-- Last 7 days
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'

-- Last hour
SELECT * FROM events WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'

-- Next week (future events)
SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE due_date < NOW() + INTERVAL '7 days'

-- Shorthand units
SELECT * FROM metrics WHERE ts > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 min'
```

#### Common Patterns

| Use Case | Query |
|----------|-------|
| Last 24 hours | `WHERE ts > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'` |
| This week | `WHERE ts > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'` |
| Last month | `WHERE ts > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 month'` |
| Recent activity | `WHERE last_seen > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'` |

### Logical Operators

```sql
-- AND
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE category = 'tech' AND price > 50

-- OR
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE category = 'tech' OR category = 'science'

-- Combined
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE (category = 'tech' OR category = 'ai') AND price > 100
```

### Vector Search with Filters

Combine vector search with metadata filters:

```sql
SELECT * FROM docs 
WHERE vector NEAR $v AND category = 'tech' AND price > 50
LIMIT 10
```

### Sparse Vector Search (v2.2+)

Use `SPARSE_NEAR` for sparse vector similarity search (SPLADE, BM42, or custom sparse embeddings):

```sql
-- With parameter placeholder
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector SPARSE_NEAR $sv

-- With literal sparse vector (indices and values)
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector SPARSE_NEAR $sparse_query LIMIT 10
```

#### SparseVectorExpr

The `SPARSE_NEAR` clause accepts a `SparseVectorExpr` with two variants:

| Variant | Syntax | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Parameter** | `$name` | Resolved at runtime from query params |
| **Literal** | `$sparse_query` | Sparse vector passed as parameter |

Sparse vectors are scored using inner product. The scoring algorithm uses MaxScore DAAT (Document-At-A-Time) for efficient top-K retrieval with early termination.

#### Hybrid Search: NEAR + SPARSE_NEAR

Combine dense and sparse search in a single query using `USING FUSION`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM docs
WHERE vector NEAR $dense AND vector SPARSE_NEAR $sparse
USING FUSION(strategy = 'rrf', k = 60)
LIMIT 10
```

> **Note:** The `FUSE BY` syntax is planned but not yet implemented in the grammar. Use `USING FUSION(...)` for hybrid search. See the [FUSE BY clause (planned)](#fuse-by-clause-v22-planned-syntax) section below for the planned syntax.

### Similarity Function (v1.3+)

The `similarity()` function enables **threshold-based vector filtering** - filter results by similarity score rather than just finding nearest neighbors.

#### Syntax

```sql
similarity(field, vector_expr) <operator> threshold
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `field` | The vector field name (e.g., `vector`, `embedding`) |
| `vector_expr` | A parameter (`$v`) or literal vector (`[0.1, 0.2, ...]`) |
| `operator` | Comparison: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `=` |
| `threshold` | Similarity score (0.0 to 1.0 for cosine/dot) |

#### Examples

```sql
-- Find documents with similarity > 0.8
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE similarity(vector, $query) > 0.8

-- High precision filtering (>= 0.9)
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE similarity(embedding, $v) >= 0.9 LIMIT 10

-- Exclude very similar documents (deduplication)
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE similarity(vector, $ref) < 0.95

-- Combined with metadata filters
SELECT * FROM docs 
WHERE similarity(vector, $q) > 0.7 
  AND category = 'technology'
  AND published = true
LIMIT 20
```

#### Use Cases

| Use Case | Query Pattern |
|----------|---------------|
| **Semantic Search** | `similarity(v, $q) > 0.75` |
| **Deduplication** | `similarity(v, $ref) < 0.9` |
| **Quality Filter** | `similarity(v, $ideal) >= 0.85` |
| **RAG Retrieval** | `similarity(embedding, $query) > 0.7 AND source = 'docs'` |

#### Difference: NEAR vs similarity()

| Feature | `NEAR` | `similarity()` |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Purpose | Find K nearest neighbors | Filter by score threshold |
| Returns | Top-K results | All matching results |
| Control | `LIMIT N` | Threshold value |
| Best for | "Find similar" | "Filter by quality" |

```sql
-- NEAR: "Give me 10 most similar docs"
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector NEAR $v LIMIT 10

-- similarity(): "Give me docs with similarity > 0.8"
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE similarity(vector, $v) > 0.8
```

## ORDER BY Clause (v2.0+)

Sort results by one or more columns or expressions.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM docs ORDER BY created_at DESC
SELECT * FROM docs ORDER BY category ASC, price DESC
```

### Order by Similarity

Sort by vector similarity score:

```sql
-- Order by similarity (highest first)
SELECT * FROM docs 
WHERE similarity(embedding, $query) > 0.5
ORDER BY similarity(embedding, $query) DESC
LIMIT 10

-- Multi-column with similarity
SELECT * FROM docs 
WHERE vector NEAR $v
ORDER BY similarity(vector, $v) DESC, created_at DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### Direction

| Direction | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ASC` | Ascending (default) |
| `DESC` | Descending |

## GROUP BY and HAVING (v2.0+)

Aggregate results by groups.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM docs GROUP BY category
SELECT category, AVG(price) FROM products GROUP BY category HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
```

### Aggregate Functions

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `COUNT(*)` | Count rows | `COUNT(*)` |
| `COUNT(field)` | Count non-null values | `COUNT(price)` |
| `SUM(field)` | Sum of values | `SUM(quantity)` |
| `AVG(field)` | Average value | `AVG(rating)` |
| `MIN(field)` | Minimum value | `MIN(price)` |
| `MAX(field)` | Maximum value | `MAX(score)` |

### Examples

```sql
-- Count by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM products GROUP BY category

-- Average with filter
SELECT category, AVG(price) 
FROM products 
WHERE similarity(embedding, $query) > 0.6
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY AVG(price) DESC

-- HAVING clause
SELECT category, COUNT(*) 
FROM docs 
GROUP BY category 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC

-- Multiple aggregates
SELECT category, COUNT(*), AVG(price), MAX(rating)
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING AVG(price) > 50
```

## JOIN Clause (v2.0+)

Combine data from multiple collections.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
[INNER|LEFT|RIGHT|FULL] JOIN table2 ON condition
```

### Join Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `JOIN` / `INNER JOIN` | Only matching rows |
| `LEFT JOIN` | All from left + matching right |
| `RIGHT JOIN` | All from right + matching left |
| `FULL JOIN` | All from both tables |

### Examples

```sql
-- Inner join
SELECT orders.id, customers.name
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id

-- Left join with filter
SELECT p.title, c.name AS category_name
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id
WHERE similarity(p.embedding, $query) > 0.7
LIMIT 20

-- Using clause (alternative to ON)
SELECT * FROM orders JOIN customers USING (customer_id)

-- Multiple joins
SELECT o.id, c.name, p.title
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id
```

## Set Operations (v2.0+)

Combine results from multiple queries.

### UNION

Combine results, removing duplicates:

```sql
SELECT id, title FROM articles WHERE category = 'tech'
UNION
SELECT id, title FROM articles WHERE category = 'science'
```

### UNION ALL

Combine results, keeping duplicates:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE similarity(v, $q) > 0.8
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table2 WHERE similarity(v, $q) > 0.8
```

### INTERSECT

Only rows in both queries:

```sql
SELECT id FROM liked_items WHERE user_id = 1
INTERSECT
SELECT id FROM liked_items WHERE user_id = 2
```

### EXCEPT

Rows in first query but not second:

```sql
SELECT id FROM all_items
EXCEPT
SELECT id FROM purchased_items
```

## USING FUSION - Hybrid Search (v2.0+)

Combine multiple search strategies with result fusion.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM docs
WHERE vector NEAR $v AND text MATCH 'query'
USING FUSION(strategy, k, weights)
```

### Fusion Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `rrf` | Reciprocal Rank Fusion | Balanced ranking (default) |
| `weighted` | Weighted combination | Custom importance |
| `maximum` | Take highest score | Best match wins |

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `strategy` | string | `rrf` | Fusion algorithm |
| `k` | integer | 60 | RRF constant |
| `weights` | array | `[0.5, 0.5]` | Strategy weights |

### Examples

```sql
-- Default RRF fusion
SELECT * FROM docs
WHERE vector NEAR $v
USING FUSION(rrf)
LIMIT 10

-- Weighted fusion (70% vector, 30% text)
SELECT * FROM docs
WHERE vector NEAR $semantic AND content MATCH $keywords
USING FUSION(weighted, weights = [0.7, 0.3])
LIMIT 20

-- Maximum score fusion
SELECT * FROM docs
WHERE similarity(embedding, $q1) > 0.5
USING FUSION(maximum)
LIMIT 10
```

## FUSE BY Clause (v2.2) -- PLANNED SYNTAX

> **PLANNED SYNTAX**: `FUSE BY` is not yet implemented in the grammar. Use `USING FUSION(...)` instead for all hybrid search queries. The `FUSE BY` syntax is documented here as a planned alternative that may be added in a future release.

The planned `FUSE BY` clause is designed to provide explicit control over how dense and sparse search results are combined in hybrid queries.

**Current working syntax** (use this):
```sql
SELECT * FROM docs
WHERE vector NEAR $dense AND vector SPARSE_NEAR $sparse
USING FUSION(strategy = 'rrf', k = 60)
LIMIT 10
```

### Planned Syntax

```sql
-- PLANNED SYNTAX: not yet implemented in grammar. Use USING FUSION(...) instead.
SELECT * FROM <collection>
WHERE vector NEAR $dense AND vector SPARSE_NEAR $sparse
FUSE BY <strategy>   -- PLANNED: not yet in grammar
LIMIT <n>
```

### Fusion Strategies

#### RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)

Combines results by rank position. Each result's fused score is the sum of `1 / (k + rank)` across both branches.

```sql
-- PLANNED SYNTAX: not yet implemented. Use USING FUSION(strategy = 'rrf', k = 60) instead.
FUSE BY RRF(k=60)   -- PLANNED: not yet in grammar

-- Current working equivalent:
USING FUSION(strategy = 'rrf', k = 60)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `k` | integer | 60 | Ranking constant. Lower k gives more weight to top ranks |

#### RSF (Reciprocal Score Fusion)

Combines results by normalized score with explicit weights. Scores are min-max normalized per branch, then combined as weighted sum.

```sql
-- PLANNED SYNTAX: not yet implemented. Use USING FUSION(strategy = 'rsf', ...) instead.
FUSE BY RSF(dense_weight=0.7, sparse_weight=0.3)   -- PLANNED: not yet in grammar

-- Current working equivalent:
USING FUSION(strategy = 'rsf', dense_weight = 0.7, sparse_weight = 0.3)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `dense_weight` | float | 0.5 | Weight for dense search scores |
| `sparse_weight` | float | 0.5 | Weight for sparse search scores |

**Constraint:** `dense_weight + sparse_weight` must equal 1.0.

### Examples

```sql
-- Balanced hybrid search (equal weight)
-- PLANNED: FUSE BY RRF(k=60)
-- Current working syntax:
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE vector NEAR $query_embedding AND vector SPARSE_NEAR $bm25_query
USING FUSION(strategy = 'rrf', k = 60)
LIMIT 20

-- Keyword-heavy hybrid (30% semantic, 70% keyword)
-- PLANNED: FUSE BY RSF(dense_weight=0.3, sparse_weight=0.7)
-- Current working syntax:
SELECT * FROM docs
WHERE vector NEAR $dense AND vector SPARSE_NEAR $sparse
USING FUSION(strategy = 'rsf', dense_weight = 0.3, sparse_weight = 0.7)
LIMIT 10

-- Hybrid with metadata filter
-- PLANNED: FUSE BY RRF(k=60)
-- Current working syntax:
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE vector NEAR $v AND vector SPARSE_NEAR $sv
  AND category = 'electronics'
USING FUSION(strategy = 'rrf', k = 60)
LIMIT 10
```

## LIMIT and OFFSET

```sql
-- Limit results
SELECT * FROM docs LIMIT 10

-- Pagination
SELECT * FROM docs LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20
```

## WITH Clause (Search Options)

Control search behavior with the `WITH` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector NEAR $v LIMIT 10
WITH (mode = 'accurate', ef_search = 512, timeout_ms = 5000)
```

### Available Options

| Option | Type | Values | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `mode` | string | `fast`, `balanced`, `accurate`, `perfect`, `adaptive` | Search mode preset |
| `ef_search` | integer | 16-4096 | HNSW ef_search parameter |
| `timeout_ms` | integer | >=100 | Query timeout in milliseconds |
| `rerank` | boolean | `true`/`false` | Enable reranking for quantized vectors |

### Examples

```sql
-- Fast search for autocomplete
SELECT * FROM suggestions WHERE vector NEAR $v LIMIT 5 WITH (mode = 'fast')

-- High accuracy for production
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector NEAR $v LIMIT 10 WITH (mode = 'accurate')

-- Custom ef_search
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector NEAR $v LIMIT 10 WITH (ef_search = 512)

-- Combined options
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector NEAR $v LIMIT 10 
WITH (mode = 'balanced', ef_search = 256, rerank = true)
```

## Value Types

### Strings

```sql
'hello world'
"double quotes also work"
```

#### String Escaping

To include a single quote inside a string, **double it** (`''`):

```sql
-- Correct: Use '' to escape single quotes
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE name = 'O''Brien'      -- Matches "O'Brien"
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE text = 'It''s working' -- Matches "It's working"

-- Empty string
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE name = ''
```

⚠️ **Backslash escaping is NOT supported**:

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG: This will cause a parse error
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE name = 'O\'Brien'

-- ✅ CORRECT: Use double single-quote
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE name = 'O''Brien'
```

Unicode characters are fully supported:

```sql
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE title = '日本語テキスト'
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE emoji = '🚀 Launch'
```

### Numbers

```sql
42          -- integer
3.14        -- float
-100        -- negative
```

### Booleans

```sql
true
false
```

### Vectors

```sql
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]           -- literal vector
$query_vector                   -- parameter reference
```

### NULL

```sql
NULL
```

## Parameters

Use `$name` syntax for parameterized queries:

```sql
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector NEAR $query_vector AND category = $cat
```

Parameters are resolved at runtime from the query context.

## Reserved Keywords

The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers without escaping:

```
SELECT, FROM, WHERE, AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, MATCH,
IS, NULL, TRUE, FALSE, LIMIT, OFFSET, WITH, NEAR, ASC, DESC,
ORDER, BY, AS, SIMILARITY
```

### Identifier Quoting (v1.3+)

To use reserved keywords as column or table names, quote them with **backticks** or **double quotes**:

```sql
-- Backtick escaping (MySQL-style)
SELECT `select`, `from`, `order` FROM docs

-- Double-quote escaping (SQL standard)
SELECT "select", "from", "order" FROM docs

-- Mixed styles in same query
SELECT `select`, "order" FROM my_table WHERE `limit` > 10
```

#### Escaping Quotes Inside Identifiers

To include a double-quote inside a double-quoted identifier, **double it**:

```sql
-- Column named: col"name
SELECT "col""name" FROM docs
```

#### Examples with All Clauses

```sql
-- Reserved keyword as table name
SELECT * FROM `order`

-- Reserved keywords in WHERE
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE `select` = 'value' AND `from` LIKE '%pattern%'

-- Reserved keywords in ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM docs ORDER BY `order` ASC

-- Reserved keywords in GROUP BY
SELECT `group`, COUNT(*) FROM docs GROUP BY `group`

-- Reserved keyword as alias
SELECT id AS `select` FROM docs
```

## Examples

### Basic Queries

```sql
-- Get all documents
SELECT * FROM documents

-- Get specific fields with limit
SELECT id, payload.title FROM articles LIMIT 100

-- Pagination
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40
```

### Vector Search

```sql
-- Simple vector search
SELECT * FROM embeddings WHERE vector NEAR $query LIMIT 10

-- Vector search with metadata filter
SELECT id, score, payload.title FROM docs 
WHERE vector NEAR $v AND category = 'technology' 
LIMIT 5

-- High-accuracy search
SELECT * FROM legal_docs WHERE vector NEAR $q LIMIT 10 
WITH (mode = 'accurate')
```

### Hybrid Search (Dense + Sparse)

```sql
-- Hybrid search with RRF fusion
SELECT * FROM docs
WHERE vector NEAR $dense_query AND vector SPARSE_NEAR $sparse_query
USING FUSION(strategy = 'rrf', k = 60)
LIMIT 10

-- Hybrid search with weighted score fusion
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE vector NEAR $embedding AND vector SPARSE_NEAR $bm25
USING FUSION(strategy = 'rsf', dense_weight = 0.6, sparse_weight = 0.4)
LIMIT 20

-- Sparse-only search
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector SPARSE_NEAR $keywords LIMIT 10

-- Train a quantizer then search with PQ compression
TRAIN QUANTIZER ON embeddings WITH (m=8, k=256)
```

### Complex Filters

```sql
-- Multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE category IN ('electronics', 'computers') 
  AND price BETWEEN 100 AND 1000
  AND rating >= 4.0
LIMIT 50

-- Text matching with vector search
SELECT * FROM articles 
WHERE vector NEAR $v 
  AND title LIKE '%AI%'
  AND published IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10
```

## MATCH Clause (v2.1+)

Execute graph pattern matching queries with optional vector similarity filtering.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
MATCH <pattern>
[WHERE <conditions>]
RETURN <projection>
[ORDER BY <expression>]
[LIMIT <n>]
```

### Pattern Syntax

```sql
-- Node pattern
(alias:Label {property: value})

-- Relationship pattern
-[alias:TYPE]->    -- outgoing
<-[alias:TYPE]-    -- incoming
-[alias:TYPE]-     -- undirected

-- Variable length paths
-[*1..3]->         -- 1 to 3 hops
```

### Examples

```sql
-- Simple graph traversal
MATCH (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(b:Person)
RETURN a.name, b.name

-- With similarity filter (RAG use case)
MATCH (doc:Document)
WHERE similarity(doc.embedding, $query) > 0.8
RETURN doc.title, doc.content
ORDER BY similarity() DESC
LIMIT 5

-- Combined graph + vector + column (AIOps)
MATCH (incident:Ticket)-[:IMPACTS]->(service:Microservice)
WHERE similarity(incident.log_embedding, $error_vec) > 0.85
  AND incident.status = 'RESOLVED'
  AND service.criticality = 'HIGH'
RETURN incident.solution, service.name
ORDER BY similarity() DESC
LIMIT 3
```

### Execution Strategies

The query planner automatically chooses the optimal execution strategy:

| Strategy | When Used | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **GraphFirst** | No similarity condition | Traverse graph, then filter |
| **VectorFirst** | Similarity on start node | Vector search, then validate graph |
| **Parallel** | Large collection, high threshold | Execute both in parallel |

### REST API

```
POST /collections/{name}/match
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "MATCH (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(b) WHERE similarity(a.vec, $v) > 0.8 RETURN a.name",
  "params": { "v": [0.1, 0.2, ...] }
}
```

## TRAIN QUANTIZER Command (v2.2+)

Explicitly train a Product Quantizer on a collection's vector data.

### Syntax

```sql
TRAIN QUANTIZER ON <collection> WITH (m=<subspaces>, k=<codebook_size>)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `m` | integer | 8 | Number of subspaces (vector is split into m sub-vectors) |
| `k` | integer | 256 | Codebook size per subspace (number of centroids) |

### Semantics

- Training is **explicit** -- it does not happen automatically on collection creation or data insertion.
- The collection must contain enough vectors for meaningful training (recommended: at least `k` vectors).
- After training, subsequent searches on the collection can use PQ-compressed distance computation (ADC).
- Training uses k-means++ initialization for codebook construction.

### Examples

```sql
-- Train with default-like parameters
TRAIN QUANTIZER ON my_embeddings WITH (m=8, k=256)

-- Higher compression (more subspaces)
TRAIN QUANTIZER ON large_collection WITH (m=16, k=256)

-- Finer codebooks
TRAIN QUANTIZER ON precision_collection WITH (m=8, k=512)
```

### Notes

- Training may take several seconds for large collections (100K+ vectors).
- OPQ (Optimized Product Quantization) can be enabled via the Rust API or REST API but is not exposed in VelesQL syntax.
- Re-training overwrites the existing quantizer. Export the previous quantizer if rollback is needed.

## Error Handling

VelesQL returns structured errors:

| Error Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `SyntaxError` | Invalid query syntax |
| `SemanticError` | Valid syntax but invalid semantics |
| `CollectionNotFound` | Referenced collection doesn't exist |
| `ColumnNotFound` | Referenced column doesn't exist |
| `TypeMismatch` | Incompatible types in comparison |
| `Timeout` | Query exceeded timeout_ms |
