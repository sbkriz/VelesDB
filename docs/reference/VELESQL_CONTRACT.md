# VelesQL REST Contract

Canonical contract for VelesQL server endpoints and payloads.

- Contract version: `2.1.0`
- Last updated: `2026-03-04`

This document is the normative REST contract baseline for VelesQL.
When behavior differs between docs and runtime, runtime must be fixed or this
document must be updated in the same PR.

## Endpoints

### `POST /query`

Unified endpoint for `SELECT` and top-level `MATCH` queries.

Request body:

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector NEAR $v LIMIT 10",
  "params": { "v": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3] },
  "collection": "docs"
}
```

Aggregation queries are accepted on `/query` for backward compatibility, but
`/aggregate` is the explicit endpoint for aggregation workloads.

### `POST /aggregate`

Aggregation-only endpoint for `GROUP BY`/`HAVING`/aggregate queries.

Request body:

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM docs GROUP BY category",
  "params": {},
  "collection": "docs"
}
```

Rules:

- Query must be aggregation-shaped (`GROUP BY` or aggregate functions in `SELECT`).
- Non-aggregation queries return `422` with `VELESQL_AGGREGATION_ERROR`.
- Collection is resolved from `FROM <collection>` first, then optional body `collection`.

Success response shape:

```json
{
  "result": [{ "category": "tech", "count": 42 }],
  "timing_ms": 1.12,
  "meta": {
    "velesql_contract_version": "2.1.0",
    "count": 1
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `collection` is optional for `SELECT ... FROM <collection> ...`.
- `collection` is mandatory for top-level `MATCH (...) ...` sent to `/query`.
- For graph-only execution, `/collections/{name}/match` remains supported.
- `SELECT ... WHERE ... AND MATCH (...)` is supported and does not require
  `collection` in body when `FROM <collection>` is present.

Success response shape:

```json
{
  "results": [{ "id": 1, "score": 0.98, "payload": { "title": "Doc" } }],
  "timing_ms": 1.42,
  "took_ms": 1,
  "rows_returned": 1,
  "meta": {
    "velesql_contract_version": "2.1.0",
    "count": 1
  }
}
```

### `POST /collections/{name}/match`

Collection-scoped endpoint for graph `MATCH` queries.

Success response shape:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "bindings": { "a": 1, "b": 2 },
      "score": 0.91,
      "depth": 1,
      "projected": { "a.name": "Alice" }
    }
  ],
  "took_ms": 4,
  "count": 1,
  "meta": {
    "velesql_contract_version": "2.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Standard Error Model (VelesQL)

Semantic/runtime errors for VelesQL endpoints use:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VELESQL_MISSING_COLLECTION",
    "message": "MATCH query via /query requires `collection` in request body",
    "hint": "Add `collection` to the /query JSON body or use /collections/{name}/match",
    "details": {
      "field": "collection",
      "endpoint": "/query",
      "query_type": "MATCH"
    }
  }
}
```

Current codes:

- `VELESQL_MISSING_COLLECTION`
- `VELESQL_COLLECTION_NOT_FOUND`
- `VELESQL_EXECUTION_ERROR`
- `VELESQL_AGGREGATION_ERROR`

`/collections/{name}/match` keeps compatibility fields (`error`, `code`) and now also returns `hint` and optional `details`.

Syntax errors still use parser-specific payload (`QueryErrorResponse` with `type/message/position/query`).

## Syntax Profiles (Frozen)

These syntax profiles are frozen for this contract version:

- Top-level query: `SELECT ...` or `MATCH (...) ...`
- Hybrid WHERE predicate: `SELECT ... FROM <collection> WHERE ... AND MATCH (...)`
- Text predicate: `<field> MATCH 'text'`

Reference grammar:

- `docs/reference/VELESQL_SPEC.md`
- `docs/VELESQL_SPEC.md`

## Stable vs Experimental

| Capability | Contract state | Runtime state |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...` | Stable | Stable |
| `SELECT ... WHERE ... AND MATCH (...)` | Stable | Stable |
| top-level `MATCH (...) RETURN ...` | Stable | Stable |
| top-level `MATCH` via `/query` with body `collection` | Stable | Stable |
| aggregation via `/aggregate` | Stable | Stable |
| `JOIN ... ON` | Stable | Stable |
| `JOIN ... USING (...)` | Stable | Stable for single-column USING |
| `LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN` | Stable | Stable |
| `GROUP BY` / `HAVING` | Stable | Stable |
| `UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT` | Stable | Stable |

## Validation Matrix

Contract test cases are listed in:

- `docs/reference/VELESQL_CONFORMANCE_CASES.md`

Each invalid case maps to an expected HTTP status and an expected error shape.

## Feature Execution Status

| Feature | Parser | Executor |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `JOIN ... ON` | Supported | Supported (inner join) |
| `JOIN ... USING (...)` | Supported | Supported for single-column USING |
| `LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN` | Supported | Supported |
| `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` | Supported | Supported |
| `ORDER BY similarity()` | Supported | Supported |
| `UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT` | Supported | Supported |

## Compatibility Notes

- Existing clients reading `timing_ms` + `rows_returned` continue to work.
- New clients should prefer `meta.velesql_contract_version` for contract-aware handling.
