# VelesQL REST Contract

Canonical contract for VelesQL server endpoints and payloads.

- Contract version: `3.6.0`
- Last updated: `2026-03-31`

This document is the normative REST contract baseline for VelesQL.
When behavior differs between docs and runtime, runtime must be fixed or this
document must be updated in the same PR.

## Endpoints

### `POST /query`

Unified endpoint for `SELECT` and top-level `MATCH` queries.

Request body:

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM docs WHERE vector NEAR $v LIMIT 10",
  "params": { "v": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3] },
  "collection": "docs"
}
```

Aggregation queries are accepted on `/query` for backward compatibility, but
`/aggregate` is the explicit endpoint for aggregation workloads.

### `POST /aggregate`

Aggregation-only endpoint for `GROUP BY`/`HAVING`/aggregate queries.

Request body:

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM docs GROUP BY category",
  "params": {},
  "collection": "docs"
}
```

Rules:

- Query must be aggregation-shaped (`GROUP BY` or aggregate functions in `SELECT`).
- Non-aggregation queries return `422` with `VELESQL_AGGREGATION_ERROR`.
- Collection is resolved from `FROM <collection>` first, then optional body `collection`.

Success response shape:

```json
{
  "result": [{ "category": "tech", "count": 42 }],
  "timing_ms": 1.12,
  "meta": {
    "velesql_contract_version": "3.3.0",
    "count": 1
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `collection` is optional for `SELECT ... FROM <collection> ...`.
- `collection` is mandatory for top-level `MATCH (...) ...` sent to `/query`.
- For graph-only execution, `/collections/{name}/match` remains supported.
- `SELECT ... WHERE ... AND MATCH (...)` is supported and does not require
  `collection` in body when `FROM <collection>` is present.

Success response shape:

```json
{
  "results": [{ "id": 1, "score": 0.98, "payload": { "title": "Doc" } }],
  "timing_ms": 1.42,
  "took_ms": 1,
  "rows_returned": 1,
  "meta": {
    "velesql_contract_version": "3.3.0",
    "count": 1
  }
}
```

### DDL and Mutation Statements via `/query`

DDL statements (`CREATE COLLECTION`, `DROP COLLECTION`, `CREATE INDEX`, `DROP INDEX`,
`ANALYZE`, `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER COLLECTION`) and graph/delete mutation statements
(`INSERT EDGE`, `DELETE EDGE`, `DELETE FROM`, `INSERT NODE`, `SELECT EDGES`) are
submitted through the same `POST /query` endpoint.

Request body (DDL example):

```json
{
  "query": "CREATE COLLECTION documents (dimension = 768, metric = 'cosine') WITH (storage = 'sq8')",
  "params": {},
  "collection": ""
}
```

Request body (graph mutation example — `collection` is optional, extracted from SQL):

```json
{
  "query": "INSERT EDGE INTO knowledge (source = 1, target = 2, label = 'AUTHORED_BY') WITH PROPERTIES (year = 2026)",
  "params": {}
}
```

DDL success response shape (standard `QueryResponse` with zero rows):

```json
{
  "results": [],
  "timing_ms": 2.31,
  "took_ms": 2,
  "rows_returned": 0,
  "meta": {
    "velesql_contract_version": "3.3.0",
    "count": 0
  }
}
```

DDL error response shape uses the standard VelesQL error model (see below).

Rules:

- DDL and graph/delete mutation statements always route to `/query`, never to `/aggregate`.
- DDL statements (`CREATE COLLECTION`, `DROP COLLECTION`, `CREATE INDEX`, `DROP INDEX`, `ANALYZE`, `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER COLLECTION`) do not require a `collection` field in the body (the collection name is embedded in the SQL statement).
- `DROP COLLECTION IF EXISTS` returns success even if the collection does not exist.
- Graph/delete mutation statements (`INSERT EDGE`, `DELETE EDGE`, `DELETE FROM`, `INSERT NODE`, `SELECT EDGES`) extract the collection name from the SQL statement; the `collection` field in the request body is ignored.
- `INSERT INTO` and `UPDATE` statements flow through the standard query path and return result rows in the `results` array.

### `POST /collections/{name}/match`

Collection-scoped endpoint for graph `MATCH` queries.

Success response shape:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "bindings": { "a": 1, "b": 2 },
      "score": 0.91,
      "depth": 1,
      "projected": { "a.name": "Alice" }
    }
  ],
  "took_ms": 4,
  "count": 1,
  "meta": {
    "velesql_contract_version": "3.3.0"
  }
}
```

## Standard Error Model (VelesQL)

Semantic/runtime errors for VelesQL endpoints use:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VELESQL_MISSING_COLLECTION",
    "message": "MATCH query via /query requires `collection` in request body",
    "hint": "Add `collection` to the /query JSON body or use /collections/{name}/match",
    "details": {
      "field": "collection",
      "endpoint": "/query",
      "query_type": "MATCH"
    }
  }
}
```

Current codes:

- `VELESQL_MISSING_COLLECTION`
- `VELESQL_COLLECTION_NOT_FOUND`
- `VELESQL_EXECUTION_ERROR`
- `VELESQL_AGGREGATION_ERROR`

`/collections/{name}/match` keeps compatibility fields (`error`, `code`) and now also returns `hint` and optional `details`.

Syntax errors still use parser-specific payload (`QueryErrorResponse` with `type/message/position/query`).

## Syntax Profiles (Frozen)

These syntax profiles are frozen for this contract version:

- Top-level query: `SELECT ...` or `MATCH (...) ...`
- Hybrid WHERE predicate: `SELECT ... FROM <collection> WHERE ... AND MATCH (...)`
- Text predicate: `<field> MATCH 'text'`

Reference grammar:

- `docs/VELESQL_SPEC.md` (canonical, v3.6)

## Validation Matrix

Contract test cases are listed in:

- `conformance/velesql_parser_cases.json` (parser conformance, v3.6)
- `conformance/velesql_contract_cases.json` (runtime contract)

Each invalid case maps to an expected HTTP status and an expected error shape.

## Compatibility Notes

- Existing clients reading `timing_ms` + `rows_returned` continue to work.
- New clients should prefer `meta.velesql_contract_version` for contract-aware handling.
