## Contract Notes

- Top-level `MATCH` via `/query` requires `collection` in request body.
- Aggregation workloads have an explicit `/aggregate` endpoint; `/query` keeps backward-compatible aggregation support.
- Top-level `MATCH` is supported by `Collection::execute_query`; `Database::execute_query` rejects top-level `MATCH` by design.
- `JOIN` runtime supports `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL`.
- `LEFT/RIGHT/FULL` JOIN paths are covered by the core runtime executor.
- `USING` currently supports a single column only.
