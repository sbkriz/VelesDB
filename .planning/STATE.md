# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** Un seul moteur de connaissance pour les agents IA — Vector + Graph + ColumnStore, sub-milliseconde, offline, 15 Mo — sans glue code ni dépendances cloud.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Quality Baseline & Security

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Quality Baseline & Security)
Plan: 2 of 4 in current phase (completed)
Status: Executing phase 1
Last activity: 2026-03-06 — Completed plan 01-02 (PQ hardening + k-means++)

Progress: [▓░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 16 min
- Total execution time: 0.53 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-fixes | 2/4 | 32 min | 16 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (9 min), 01-02 (23 min)
- Trend: Executing

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Build order is QUAL → PQ Core → PQ Integration → Sparse Engine → Sparse Integration → Cache → Streaming → SDK → Docs → Release. Rationale: quality gates unblock engine work; PQ before Sparse (zero API surface change first); Cache before Streaming (write_generation counter must exist before streaming increments it).
- [Roadmap]: PQ split into two phases (Core Engine / Integration) to isolate the zero-API-surface internal work from the VelesQL TRAIN command and config changes.
- [Roadmap]: Sparse split into two phases (Engine / Integration) to isolate index internals from VelesQL grammar, REST API, and RRF hybrid wiring.
- [01-01]: Used postcard::to_allocvec + write_all instead of postcard::to_io for streaming serialization (to_io uses COBS framing, incompatible with drop-in replacement)
- [01-01]: RUSTSEC-2025-0141 exception retained in deny.toml because bincode remains as transitive dep via uniffi -> velesdb-mobile
- [01-02]: Kept assert_eq! in distance_pq_l2 as internal invariant (documented with # Panics)
- [01-02]: Promoted rand 0.8 from dev-dependency to dependency for k-means++ in production code

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~RUSTSEC-2025-0141 (bincode 1.3 on EdgeStore)~~ RESOLVED in 01-01: bincode removed from velesdb-core, replaced with postcard. Remains as transitive dep in velesdb-mobile via uniffi (acknowledged in deny.toml).
- BUG-8 (multi-alias FROM silent wrong results) is a correctness issue that would damage trust on v1.5 release — targeted for Phase 1.
- ~~`ProductQuantizer::train()` assert!/panic must be converted to Result~~ RESOLVED in 01-02: all PQ methods return Result, k-means++ init added.
